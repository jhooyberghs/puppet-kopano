## Overview

This module will install and configure Kopano with puppet. Kopano is an open-source communication stack, forked from the previously existing Zarafa.

## Setup

### What kopano affects

* The module will manage the installation of the Kopano packages, services and the configuration files in /etc/kopano.

### Prerequisites

The module expects kopano packages to be available to the server entitled with these classes.

### Start using the kopano module

To have Puppet install Kopano with the default parameters, declare the kopano class

``` puppet
class { 'kopano': }
```

The puppet module with install, configure and enable all of the currently supported daemons. The list of daemons is available in manifests/init.pp.

### Usage
You can choose to disable one or more services to be installed and configured by setting it's enabled param to false.

``` puppet
class { 'kopano':
  enable_ical => false,
}
```

It's also possible to combine the individual classes to the setup you prefer.

``` puppet
class { 'kopano::server':
	mysql_host 		=> 'mysql.example.com',
    mysql_password 	=> 'SuP3rS3cret'
}

class { 'kopano::gateway':
	pop3_enable  => 'no',
    imaps_enable => 'yes',
}
```

For configuring the different components, all supported config file options should be available. You can ofcourse also change the way the server is configured by setting it's hiera values.

``` yaml
---
kopano::server::log_method: syslog
kopano::server::mysql_host: mysql.example.com
kopano::server::mysql_password: SuP3rS3cret
kopano::server::disabled_features:
  - imap
  - pop3
  - outlook
  - mobile

```

## Limitations

* This module is currently only tested on Centos 7.
* It's ready for using the kopano db user_plugin or unix, but not yet for ldap, ldapms.
